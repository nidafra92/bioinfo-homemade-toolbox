# a simple script for joining two readsets from two independent FASTQ files
# usage: join_reads_fq.py <reads_A.fastq> <reads_B.fastq>
# tested on python version 3.7.4
# dependencies: Biopython version 1.74
# outputs: 1_union.fast, 2_intersection.fastq, 3_uniqA.fastq, 4_uniqB.fastq
# stats.txt, containing set stats

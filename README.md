# Homemade bioinfo toolbox
This is a compilation of scripts I've written over the years I've been doing bioinformatics. Many of them are for easy or dumb tasks that I just wanted to automate at some point for saving time and convenience. 

* Updated 31th/jan/2018 *

At this point there is just one script available:

* single_fasta_from_multifasta.py 

I hope to submit more utilities soon.
